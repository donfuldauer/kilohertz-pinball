# Decisions

Every ambiguity an agent resolved during the run, with rationale (PLAN.md §2.3 rule 8).
Format: `## <subphase> — <short title>` then **Decision**, **Rationale**, **Alternatives**.

## Orchestrator — Branching under a single-branch session

**Decision:** The run executes in a session restricted to one push branch (`ccr-f24f4063-bgqdfk`). The `wave/N` and `sp/<id>` branches from §2.6 are not created; each subphase lands as one or more commits on that branch, in wave order, and the commit subject is prefixed `[sp X.Y]`. The wave gate is recorded in `docs/RUN_LOG.md` instead of a `wave-N-green` tag.
**Rationale:** The session may push only to its designated branch; commit prefixes keep per-subphase history separable for later splitting.
**Alternatives:** Creating the plan's branch topology (not permitted in this session).

## Orchestrator — Role execution

**Decision:** Implementer and Independent Tester run as parallel sub-agents in the same working tree with disjoint owned paths; the Reviewer runs after both finish. Model routing follows §2.5 (Tester and Reviewer use the model that did not implement).
**Rationale:** A shared working tree is the only workspace available; disjoint paths make this equivalent to separate branches.
